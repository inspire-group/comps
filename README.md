# CoMPS

This repository structure:
 * [Test & Performance setup for WireGuard, QUIC, and Mosh](demos/)
 * [CoMPS network setup for data collection](setup/)

### Notes
The contents in `demos/` are independent from the network setup for data collection. The `demos/` folder contains proof-of-concept demos for configuring CoMPS over Mosh, WireGuard, and QUIC, as well as providing some bootstrapping for performing performance tests. Instructions for running the HotPETS 2020 demo, for instance, will be found in `demos/wg-migrate/README.md`.

All of the demos and setup above were tested on a Ubuntu 20.04 host machine.
